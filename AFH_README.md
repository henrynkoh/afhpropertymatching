## üéØ What This Service Does

The AFH Property Matching Service is a comprehensive, AI-powered platform that revolutionizes how prospective Adult Family Home (AFH) providers in Washington State find and evaluate properties for their businesses. Our service addresses the critical challenge of identifying properties that meet the complex regulatory requirements for AFH operations while providing the infrastructure and support needed for successful business launch.

### Core Mission
Our mission is to simplify the complex process of finding AFH-suitable properties by providing automated searches, expert guidance, and comprehensive resources that ensure compliance with Washington State regulations while maximizing business success potential.

### What Makes Us Different
Unlike traditional real estate search platforms, our service is specifically designed for AFH providers and incorporates deep knowledge of Washington State regulations, building codes, and licensing requirements. We don't just find properties - we evaluate them for AFH potential and provide the resources needed for successful conversion.

### Property Categories We Identify
Our advanced AI system categorizes properties into three distinct readiness levels:

- **AFH-Ready** (80-100 points): Properties that are already licensed for AFH use or have existing accessibility features that make them immediately suitable for AFH operations. These properties typically have ramps, wide doorways, accessible bathrooms, and other features required by DSHS and WABO.

- **WABO-Approved** (60-79 points): Properties that have passed building inspections and are ready for AFH conversion with minor modifications. These are typically single-level homes with adequate space and good potential for accessibility upgrades.

- **AFH-Potential** (40-59 points): Properties that show strong potential for AFH conversion but require assessment and modifications. These properties may need significant changes to meet regulatory requirements but have the fundamental characteristics needed for success.

### Target Market Analysis
Our service serves a growing market of over 2,800 licensed AFHs in Washington State, with 500+ new providers entering the market annually. The total addressable market exceeds $2.4 billion, with our serviceable market in target counties representing $480 million in opportunity.

### Regulatory Compliance Focus
Every aspect of our service is designed with regulatory compliance in mind. We ensure that all property recommendations meet Washington State requirements under WAC 388-76 (Minimum Licensing Requirements) and RCW 70.128 (Adult Family Homes statute), as well as DSHS guidelines and WABO building code standards.
