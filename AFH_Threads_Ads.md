üè† Starting an Adult Family Home business in Washington State?

I've been helping AFH providers find the perfect properties for 3+ years. Here's what I've learned about what makes a property ideal for AFH conversion:

üßµ Thread below with key insights...
```

**Thread Posts**:

1/8 The most important factor: SINGLE-LEVEL DESIGN
Rambler/ranch homes score 25 points higher in our AFH potential algorithm. Why? Evacuation requirements - all residents must exit within 5 minutes, and stairs slow this down significantly.

2/8 Bedroom requirements: MINIMUM 3 bedrooms
AFHs can house up to 6 residents, plus you need space for caregiver quarters. Our system automatically flags properties with 3+ bedrooms as high potential.

3/8 Bathroom requirements: MINIMUM 2 bathrooms
DSHS requires adequate bathroom facilities. Properties with 2+ bathrooms score 15 points higher in our algorithm.

4/8 Square footage: 2000+ sq ft ideal
You need space for common areas, dining, and activities. Our scoring system gives maximum points to properties 2000+ sq ft.

5/8 Lot size matters: 0.25+ acres preferred
Space for ramps, parking, and accessibility features. Properties with larger lots score higher for AFH potential.

6/8 Accessibility features: HUGE bonus
Existing grab bars, wide doorways, accessible bathrooms? These properties score 15 points higher and are often AFH-ready immediately.

7/8 Location: Near medical facilities
Proximity to hospitals and medical centers is important for resident care. Properties near medical areas get bonus points.

8/8 Our automated system searches 4 counties daily (King, Pierce, Thurston, Lewis) and scores every property 1-100 for AFH potential. Properties scoring 60+ get sent to our subscribers.

## Campaign 5: "Common AFH Mistakes"

### Thread Content
**Opening Post**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Common AFH Mistakes That Cost Time & Money

After helping 500+ AFH providers, I've seen the same mistakes over and over. Here are the biggest ones to avoid:

üßµ Thread below with the complete list...
```

**Thread Posts**:
```
1/8 Mistake #1: Not Understanding Evacuation Requirements
Many people think any single-level home works. Wrong! You need specific egress requirements, proper door widths, and accessible exits. This mistake can cost $50K+ in modifications.

2/8 Mistake #2: Underestimating Licensing Timeline
Most people think it takes 3-6 months. Reality: 6-12 months minimum. Don't start looking for properties until you understand the full timeline and requirements.

3/8 Mistake #3: Not Budgeting for Modifications
Even "perfect" properties need modifications. Budget 10-20% of property cost for AFH-specific changes like grab bars, wider doorways, and accessibility features.

4/8 Mistake #4: Ignoring County Permit Requirements
Each county has different requirements. Some need special permits, others have zoning restrictions. Check county requirements BEFORE making an offer.

5/8 Mistake #5: Not Understanding Insurance Requirements
Minimum $500K per occurrence, $1M aggregate. State/DSHS must be named additional insured. Medicaid contracts may require higher limits.

6/8 Mistake #6: Choosing the Wrong Location
Proximity to medical facilities matters. So does neighborhood zoning, parking availability, and accessibility for emergency vehicles.

7/8 Mistake #7: Not Getting Professional Help
AFH licensing is complex. Get help from experienced professionals who understand the process. It's worth the investment.

8/8 How Our Service Helps Avoid These Mistakes:
- Property scoring includes compliance factors
- Resource dashboard has all requirements
- County permit verification included
- Expert guidance throughout the process

Don't compromise on property requirements. Single-level, adequate bedrooms/bathrooms, and good location are non-negotiable. Our scoring system helps identify the best properties.

AFH regulations are complex. Take time to understand WAC 388-76, RCW 70.128, and local requirements. Our resource dashboard has everything you need.

Property cost is just the beginning. Budget for modifications, licensing, training, insurance, and operating costs. Plan for 20-30% more than you think.

4/8 Tip #4: Get Professional Help
Don't try to do everything yourself. Get help from experienced professionals who understand AFH requirements. It's worth the investment.

5/8 Tip #5: Build Relationships
Network with other AFH providers, healthcare professionals, and local officials. Relationships are key to success in this business.

6/8 Tip #6: Focus on Quality Care
